> ### You're known by your company and now you're company is your shadow!

### Description:

This is game for windows platform in which shadow is the true master of an object!
In this game we switch to a different world called shadow-world where the shadows of an object has souls which can be moved around under the cover of shadows only and when we switch back to normal world the object has to follow the orders given by the active shadow soul and as the shadow souls know the light which gave birth to them so they follow only those.

In case of discrepancies in determining the position of object by a single shadow soul, we have to place another shadow soul such that it clearly describes the position of object in the normal world!

The objective of the game is to collect the Obsidian

### Bugs and Issues:

* Sometimes the shadow souls arenâ€™t able to access the whole of the shadow cover!

* The navigation gets a little bit difficult sometimes due to the wide range of camera movements.
